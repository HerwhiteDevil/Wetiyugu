# SwiftWheels - Static Car Selling Website

This is a simple, beautiful static website template for selling or showcasing cars.
It includes modern layout, animations, a small carousel, and contact form stub.

## Structure
- `index.html` - main page
- `assets/css/styles.css` - styles
- `assets/js/main.js` - interactivity
- `assets/images/` - sample car images (included)

## How to deploy
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push the files.
2. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages and set the branch to `main` (or `gh-pages`) and `/ (root)` directory.
3. Save — your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Customize
- Replace the images in `assets/images/` with your own photos.
- Edit pricing and metadata in `index.html`.
- Connect a backend or form provider (e.g., Formspree) if you want real enquiries.
